# NVIDIA Stock Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting NVIDIA's stock prices using historical data. The project leverages various data science techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling.

## Features:
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming stock price data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and patterns in stock movements.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing regression models, time-series forecasting, or deep learning techniques (e.g., LSTMs).
- **Visualization**: Plotting stock trends and model predictions.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Future Improvements:
- Incorporate more features like news sentiment analysis.
- Experiment with advanced deep learning architectures.
